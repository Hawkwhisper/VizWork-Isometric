Code for work~

Viz: This is a 1 time process; I think you already have node~ so :P

### Install Nodejs
Make sure you have nodejs installed, which can be downloaded here: 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Download the zip from the repository
select "Code" and then "Download Zip" from green button on the top right.

Extract the zip file
Open the folder you extracted this in, then hold shift and right click an empty space. You should see "Open powershell here" or similar~ click that and then type "npm install"


## ALL SET!
Finally, whenever you want to run it, just type "npm start" in the powershell you opened.
